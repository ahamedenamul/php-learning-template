# PHP Learning Template 🚀

This is my personal starter template for learning PHP. I use this structure to practice daily coding challenges without worrying about HTML/CSS setup every time.

## ✨ Features
- **Responsive Design**: Clean UI with Header and Footer.
- **Dynamic Greeting**: Shows Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening based on time.
- **Timezone Setup**: Configured for `Asia/Dhaka`.
- **Ready-to-Code**: Just open `index.php` and start writing PHP inside the `.main-body` section.

## 📂 File Structure
- `index.php` - Main file for practice.
- `style.css` - Beautiful gradient styling.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download or Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.php` in VS Code.
3. Write your PHP code inside the `main-body` div:
   ```php
   <div class="main-body">
       <!-- Write your PHP practice code here -->
   </div>
   ```
4. Run it on XAMPP/Localhost.
